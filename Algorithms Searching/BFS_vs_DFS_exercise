If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS

If the tree is very wide: DFS

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

Finding the shortest path: BFS
